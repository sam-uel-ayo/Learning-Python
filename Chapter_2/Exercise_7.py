#  As an alternative to APR, the interest accrued on an account is often described in terms of a
#  nominal rate and the number of compounding periods. For example, if the interest rate is 3%
#  and the interest is compounded quarterly, the account actually earns 3/4 % interest every 3 months.
#  Modify the futval.py program to use this method of entering the interest rate. The program
#  should prompt the user for the yearly rate (rate) and the number of times that the interest is
#  compounded each year (periods). To compute the value in ten years, the program will loop
#  10 * periods times and accrue rate/period interest on each iteration.

#            print("of a 10-year investment.")
