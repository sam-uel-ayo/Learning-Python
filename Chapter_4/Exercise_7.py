# 7. Circle Intersection. Write a program that computes the intersection of a circle with a horizontal line and displays the information textually and graphically.
#     Input: Radius of the circle and the y-intercept of the line.
#     Output: - Draw a circle centered at (0, 0) with the given radius in a window with coordinates
#               running from -10,-10 to 10,10.
#             - Draw a horizontal line across the window with the given y-intercept.
#             - Draw the two points of intersection in red.
#     Print out the x values of the points of intersection.
